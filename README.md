# My Reads React Project
## Introduction

Welcome to my React Reading app! This is a convenient site that allows users to record books they have already read, are currently reading, and want to read. You can easily search for books using the search functionality. This project is based on starter code from the Udacity React Nanodegree Program.
How to Run

This project is very easy to run and install. Just clone the repo from Github and run npm install from a terminal to install the necessary dependencies. Then run npm start and the web app will automatically open in your default browser.

This will run the frontend. The backend is hosted remotely and accessed with API calls within the frontend code, so the user doesn't need to run a backend server.
